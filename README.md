**Kailua** is an experimental type checker and integrated development environment (IDE) for the [Lua] programming language (currently only Lua 5.1 is supported).

***THIS IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT AND NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT IS PROVIDED!***

## Installation and Usage

Kailua can be used as a standalone checker or an IDE plugin.

### Standalone Checker

To install a standalone checker, [install Rust] first (1.15 or later required), then type the following:

```
cargo install -f kailua
```

(`-f` will cause the existing installation to be upgraded.)

You can run `kailua check <path to the entry point>` now.

You can also run `kailua check <path to the directory>`, if you have `kailua.json` or `.vscode/kailua.json` in that directory. The configuration format is described in the later section.

### Visual Studio Code

Kailua can be used as an IDE support for [Visual Studio Code][VSCode]. Install Kailua by typing `ext install kailua` from the Quick Launch (`Ctrl-P`). **If you are not on Windows, you should also install the standalone checker as above.**

You will see a warning that the configuration file is missing when you open a folder containing Lua codes. You need it for real-time checking.

![](doc/en-US/src/res/kailua-vsc-missing-config.png)

You can either create `.vscode/kailua.json` by hand, or search "Kailua" from the Command Palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P`) to edit one.

The following content is required for `.vscode/kailua.json`, in case you are editing it by hand:

<!-- what Kailua really supports is not exactly JSON5, but probably it's closer than JSON. -->

```json5
{
    "start_path": "<path to the entry point>",

    "preload": {
        // This indicates that we are using Lua 5.1 and all built-in libraries of it.
        "open": ["lua51"],
    },
}
```

You need to reload the current window (`Ctrl-R` or `Cmd-R`) to apply the configuration.

### Your First Kailua Code

Once you've set the entry point, you can write your first Kailua code:

```lua
--# open lua51
print('Hello, world!')
```

If you are using the configuration file, the first code can be made much simpler:

```lua
print('Hello, world!')
```

Play a bit with this code to see which errors Kailua can detect.
